  This program was created to perform the coherent potential approximation
to find various properties of material system. The inputs for the program
are taken from the output of the Static code that uses the tight-binding 
formulism.
  Currently the system is setup to run for the FeSe/Te superconductivity
system for the tetragonal P4/nmm symmetry. Some generalization was placed
in the code to allow for future systems to be used.

This version, 0.5, is setup with complex variables. Although this allows
for easier readability of the code, it may make it a little slower in 
the inversion of the matrices. For future releases, it might be benifical
to make the code not use the built-in complex calculations, but rather 
explicitly solve using these variables.
